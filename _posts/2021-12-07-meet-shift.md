Shift SC is USC's student-led platform for human-centered and socially responsible technology. We work to promote interdiscipinary conversation and action around the social implications and ethical issues of tech. 

Shift was designed around four principles:

- first, building **community**. First and foremost, Shift is a space for forming meaningful friendships with others also interested in the intersection between technology and people.
- second, focusing on the **societal and ethical side of technology**. At Shift, we challenge and grow our understanding of the too often overlooked humanistic side of tech.
- third, an **interdisciplinary approach**. Shift breaks down silos by bringing together students from all disciplines—designers, policy makers, educators... the list goes on—to think more critically about technology.
- fourth, an orientation towards the **entire campus**. Through a range of [campus-wide initiatives](https://shiftsc.org/initiatives), we aim to create opportunities for *any and all students* to engage with ideas related to human-centered and socially responsible tech. At the same time, we also host our own internal workshops and book clubs each semester to dive deeper into particular

You might have heard of some other awesome tech4good clubs on campus like [CAIS++](https://caisplusplus.usc.edu/) or [Code the Change](https://www.ctcusc.com/). Shift SC is unique in a few ways: rather than focusing on "social good", we care specifically about the ethics and human values in tech and the responsibility of companies and government for negative social externalities. Rather than building new products, we put on campus-wide inititatives and host internal discussions. And rather than leaning towards engineers and makers, we look for organizers, thinkers, and activists. 

If you haven't noticed the subtle wordplay so far, the name Shift SC was chosen for a reason. **Shift** represents a **change** in direction—a **transition** from a *technology*-centered approach of innovation and progress to a *human*-centered one—a **growth** in our awareness of the social issues that technology creates and our understanding of how we can steer it for the better.

The two phrases "human-centered" and "socially responsible" represent the core ideals of our organization:

- placing **human** well-being at the **center** of how we design and think about technology
- upholding **accountability** for the negative **social** impacts of tech

What exactly are these social implications and ethical issues of tech, anyway? The whole list is pretty long, but here's the two I'm most interested in:

- **The Attention Economy. S**ocial platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and Youtube make virtually all of their money through targetted advertisements. These perverse incentives often don't align with the best interests of individual or civic health—we end up seeing increased poltical polarization and worsened mental health.
- **Ubiquitous Algorithms.** Algorithms now determine credit card eligibility, diagnose illnesses, and determine criminal court rulings. In a world where more and more decisions are made by computers, we must define the outcomes we're optimizing for and agree upon the tradeoffs we're willing to make.

Other areas that Shifties are passionate about include:

- **Biotech**
- **AI**
- **Automation and Meaningful Work**
- **Accessible and Inclusive Design**
- **Sustainability and Environmental Health**
- **Digital Governance**
- **Ethics of Tech Education**

This diversity of our interests in technology and social issues is one of the beauties of Shift. Each of us comes from a different academic background and is drawn to Shift for a slightly different reason. What ties us together is our deep interest in technology, our deep empathy for people, and our desire to think deeper about their intersection.

Shift is also structured to take advantage of our unique interests and skillsets. The diversity of **Initiative Teams** allows each Shiftie to get involved with the work most meaningful to them and even start their own initiative down the road. We also have a **Comms Team** which spearheads the public relations, marketing and design of Shift, as well as a **Core Team** which builds internal community and focus on greater operations and strategy of the org. Shift SC is like an umbrella amongst these sub-teams, tieing us all together so that we can accomplish more than we ever could on our own.

Whatever your interests are and wherever your skillsets lie, there's a place in Shift for you. Some of us conduct research in our internal lab, while others design graphics and logos, put on social events, lead workshops, host guest speakers... the list goes on and on. 

If you want to build your understanding around human-centered and socially responsible technology, collaborate with others to strengthen campus awareness of these topics, and most importantly, join a tight-knit community of others who similarly care about these issues, then Shift is just the place for you. As someone who lies at this intersection, I've greatly appreciated the community we've built and the discussions we've had so far. Although we're a very young student organization, I couldn't be more excited for all that lies ahead for us!
