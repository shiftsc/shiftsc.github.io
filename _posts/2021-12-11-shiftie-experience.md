Whatever your interests are and wherever your skillsets lie, **there's a place in Shift for you**. Some of us conduct research in our internal lab, while others design graphics and logos, put on social events, lead workshops, host guest speakers.... the list goes on and on. 

If you want to build your understanding around human-centered and socially responsible technology, collaborate with others to strengthen campus awareness of these topics, and most importantly, join a tight-knit community of others who similarly care about these issues, then Shift is just the place for you. As someone who lies at this intersection, I've greatly appreciated the community we've built and the discussions we've had so far. Although we're a very young student organization, I couldn't be more excited for all that lies ahead for us!
