Shift's <b style="color:#B082E0">AI Ethics Curriculm</b> will be a student-led 8-week curriculum offered in Fall 2023 for students to engage with ethical questions related to the future of AI in society. 

Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought transformative effects on today's society ranging from voice assistants, search engines, to product recommendations that show you ever more engaging content. However, it has also caused negative consequences. An increasing reliance on AI has resulted in echo chambers and political polarization through social media, misdiagnoses of healthy individuals as cancer patients by IBM, and flat-out racist remarks by Twitter's AI chatbot "Tay." These examples just scratch the surface of the complications and drawbacks associated with increased reliance on AI in society. With the adoption of AI technologies and the accompanying challenges, how should we best prepare our future with AI?

During Spring 2022, the Curriculum team of Shift will be designing the curriculum content with topics that span data privacy in mobile applications, algorithmic bias in healthcare systems, economic implications of mass automation, and more. We will plan a 8-week long curriculum together with the goal of having it incorporated as a USC approved 1-unit elective course.
