The <b style="color:#B082E0">Tech4Good Student Symposium</b> will be USC's first-ever annual conference for technology and social good held at the end of this spring semester.

USC has a host of students who are doing awesome work in the realm of human-centered, socially responsible, and social good tech. However, up until now, these efforts haven't been easily visible to the entire community. The Tech4Good symposium will be an all-inclusive opportunity for students who care about social impact and tech to become inspired by each other's work and build community for this growing movement here on campus.

By students, for students, the Tech4Good Student Symposium is an all-day event at USC full of keynote speeches, presentations, and networking for everything Technology x Social Good related. Fellow USC orgs will be invited to show off their projects, research teams can present their findings, and students will be invited to give a ted-style talk related to Tech4Good. Oh, and don't forget the catered lunch ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹
