Our <b style="color:#B082E0">Digital Well-Being Workshops</b> are interactive workshops which allow participants to better understand technology and how their use of it impacts their perspective, experience, and life as a whole. The history, research, and social implications of modern day tech will be explored through a combination of presentation, round-table discussion, self-reflection, and of course.... <b style="color:#B082E0">plenty of chipotle and boba</b> ðŸ¥‘

A variety of workshop topics will be held targetting specific topics we can all relate to like Social Media and Personal Devices. After leaving one of our digital well-being workshops, attendees will feel inspired, educated, and motivated to be more conscious of the technology which deeply affects our daily experience! We want our attendees to feel confident enough to share the information they learn with those in their lives, spreading our message even further. 

Because of COVID, we are limited to offering digital well-being workshops on campus for USC students. When the situation improves, our goal is to work with local grade schools to create opportunities for conversation about digital well-being and healthy usage of devices and social media.

Through this initiative, we hope to facilitate intentional use of technology, helping all who attend improve their "digital well-being" for better well-being on the whole.
