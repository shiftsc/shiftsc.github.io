Our <b style="color:#B082E0">Digital Well-Being Workshops</b> are interactive workshops which allow participants to better understand technology and how their use of it impacts their perspective, experience, and life as a whole. History, research, and social implications of modern day tech will be explored through a combination of presentation, round-table discussion, and self-reflection. A variety of workshop topics will be held, including Social Media and Devices. After leaving one of our digital well-being workshops, attendees should feel inspired, educated, and motivated to be more conscious of the technology which surrounds them! We want our attendees to feel confident enough to share the information they learn with those in their lives, spreading our message even further. Through this initiative, we hope to facilitate intentional use of technology, helping all who attend reach optimal well-being.
