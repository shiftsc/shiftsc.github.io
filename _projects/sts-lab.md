The Science, Technology, & Society Lab (STS Lab) is a research team that uses scientific and humanistic methods to examine technologies' impacts on humans. This year, the STS Lab is creating a research index report analyzing USC students' social media usage and awareness. Through surveys, polls, and interviews, we will look at students' engagement with different online platforms and their effects on students' mental health.
