We are a community of designers, builders, thinkers, and educators driving the shift towards a technological future better aligned with human values. Through a diverse set of campus initiatives, we aim to create opportunities for conversation and action around the social implications and ethical issues of technology.

Our executive board is composed of 10 motivated students from diverse areas of study. We are working to create a space where discourse surrounding humane technology is both welcomed and celebrated. Check out our members below! And feel free to reach out to the team with any questions, concerns, or thoughts about our program.
