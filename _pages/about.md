## Our Mission

We are a community of designers, builders, thinkers, and educators driving the shift towards a technological future better aligned with human values. Through a diverse set of campus initiatives, we aim to create opportunities for conversation and action around the social implications and ethical issues of technology.

By hosting symposiums with esteemed faculty and putting on Digital Well-Being Workshops to improve student relationships with technology, we hope to draw a diverse set of attendees to our events. And our goal to create a Science and Technology Lab, as well as an AI Ethics Curriculum, Shift SC is ready to reform our campus' understanding of technology at the humane level. Time to be a part of this change.
