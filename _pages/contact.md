A: 

<b style="color:#B082E0">Q: How much commitment should I expect during my cohort of Shift?</b> <br>
A: As a Shiftie, you‚Äôll contribute around 3 hours per week: 1 hour for our general meeting, 1 hour for your subteam meeting, and some additional independent work for your initiative. Outside of that, we run weekly lunch buddies üç±¬†to meet the fam and host socials scattered throughout the semesterü•≥. We also hope to see you at our optional internal book clubs and at some of our campus-wide initiatives that your fellow Shifties will be leading.

<b style="color:#B082E0">Q: What happens after I graduate with my cohort?</b> <br>
A: You‚Äôll still remain a part of the Shift Family and can come through all socials, book clubs, and Shift exclusive events. You‚Äôll have the opportunity to apply for Shift E-Board in the spring to lead a subteam or even pitch and start your own initiative! You just won‚Äôt be a part of that specific subteam where you were contributing to initiatives during your cohort semester.
