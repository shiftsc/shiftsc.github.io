### Shift was designed around four principles:
###### 1. community
First and foremost, Shift is a space for forming meaningful friendships with others also interested in the intersection between technology and people.
###### 2. human-centered and socially responsible tech
At Shift, we challenge and grow our understanding of the often overlooked social issues stemming from tech.
###### 3. interdisciplinary approach
Shift breaks down silos by bringing together students from all disciplinesâ€”designers, policy makers, educators... the list goes onâ€”to think more critically about technology.
###### 4. campus-wide orientation
Through a diverse range of [initiatives](https://shiftsc.org/initiatives), we aim to create opportunities for *any and all students* at USC to engage with ideas related to human-centered and socially responsible tech. At the same time, we also host our own internal workshops and book clubs each semester to dive deeper into particular subfields of tech.

###### We really love this word "Shift"
It's kinda quirky ðŸ˜®, fits us well, and was chosen for reason. **Shift** represents a **change** in directionâ€”a **transition** from a *technology*-centered approach of innovation and progress to a *human*-centered oneâ€”a **growth** in our awareness of the social issues that technology creates and our understanding of how we can steer it for the better.

###### The two phrases "human-centered" and "socially responsible" represent the core ideals of our organization:

- placing **human** well-being at the **center** of how we design and think about technology
- upholding **accountability** for the negative **social** impacts of tech

You might have heard of some other awesome tech4good clubs on campus like [CAIS++](https://caisplusplus.usc.edu/) or [Code the Change](https://www.ctcusc.com/). Shift SC is unique in a few ways: rather than focusing on "social good", we care specifically about the ethics and human values in tech and the responsibility of companies and government for negative social externalities. Rather than building new products, we put on campus-wide inititatives and host internal discussions. And rather than leaning towards engineers and makers, we look for organizers, thinkers, and activists. 

What exactly are these social implications and ethical issues of tech, anyway? The whole list is pretty long, but here's a few examples:

- **The Attention Economy. S**ocial platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and Youtube make virtually all of their money through targetted advertisements. These perverse incentives often don't align with the best interests of individual or civic healthâ€”we end up seeing increased poltical polarization and worsened mental health.
- **Ubiquitous Algorithms.** Algorithms now determine credit card eligibility, diagnose illnesses, and determine criminal court rulings. In a world where more and more decisions are made by computers, we must define the outcomes we're optimizing for and agree upon the tradeoffs we're willing to make.

Other areas that Shifties are passionate about include:

- **Biotech**
- **AI**
- **Automation and Meaningful Work**
- **Accessible and Inclusive Design**
- **Sustainability and Environmental Health**
- **Digital Governance**
- **Ethics of Tech Education**

This diversity of our interests in technology and social issues is one of the beauties of Shift. Each of us comes from a different academic background and is drawn to Shift for a slightly different reason. What ties us together is our deep interest in technology, our deep empathy for people, and our desire to think deeper about their intersection.

If you want to build your understanding around human-centered and socially responsible technology, collaborate with others to strengthen campus awareness of these topics, and most importantly, join a tight-knit community of others who similarly care about these issues, then Shift is just the place for you.
