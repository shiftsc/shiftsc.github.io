### Shift was designed around four principles:
###### 1. community
First and foremost, Shift is a space for forming meaningful friendships with others also interested in the intersection between technology and people.
###### 2. human-centered and socially responsible tech
At Shift, we challenge and grow our understanding of the often overlooked social issues stemming from tech.
###### 3. interdisciplinary approach
Shift breaks down silos by bringing together students from all disciplinesâ€”designers, policy makers, educators... the list goes onâ€”to think more critically about technology.
###### 4. campus-wide orientation
Through a diverse range of [initiatives](https://shiftsc.org/initiatives), we aim to create opportunities for *any and all students* at USC to engage with ideas related to human-centered and socially responsible tech. At the same time, we also host our own internal workshops and book clubs each semester to dive deeper into particular subfields of tech.

###### We really love this word "Shift"
It's kinda quirky ðŸ˜®, fits us well, and was chosen for reason. **Shift** represents a **change** in directionâ€”a **transition** from a *technology*-centered approach of innovation and progress to a *human*-centered oneâ€”a **growth** in our awareness of the social issues that technology creates and our understanding of how we can steer it for the better.

###### The two phrases "human-centered" and "socially responsible" represent the core ideals of our organization:

- placing **human** well-being at the **center** of how we design and think about technology
- upholding **accountability** for the negative **social** impacts of tech

###### What exactly are these social implications and ethical issues of tech, anyway? 
A non-exhaustive list of some areas we're passionate about:

- **The Attention Economy.**
- **Ubiquitous Algorithms.** 
- **Biotech**
- **AI**
- **Automation and Meaningful Work**
- **Accessible and Inclusive Design**
- **Sustainability and Environmental Health**
- **Digital Governance**
- **Ethics of Tech Education**

This diversity of our interests in technology and social issues is one of the beauties of Shift. Each of us comes from a different academic background and is drawn to Shift for a slightly different reason. What [ties us together](/family) is our deep interest in technology, our deep empathy for people, and our desire to think deeper about their intersection.
